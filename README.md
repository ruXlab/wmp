Wealth management platform _(code test)_
-----------------------




### Tradeoff / room for improvements

* Each component(csv parser, evaluator, fps client) could be implemented as independent module to reduce coupling
* Number of additional validations could be implemented. For instance sum of wealth distributions must equal to 100%
* Instead of loading everything in memory streaming could be used instead
